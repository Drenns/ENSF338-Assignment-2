Memoization is a way of optimizing a search algorithm by storing previously found results for future use. 
2. 
Is the code
3.
The code calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number. For example an input of 5 would give the fifth fibonacci number (which also happens to be 5).
4.
No, as a divide-and-conquer algorithm depends on a set of data. The only input is a single integer that produces a certain number.
