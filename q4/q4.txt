Arrays:

    + Advantages +
        -Simple to implement in most programming languages.
        -Cache-Friendly, as they are stored in consecutive memory thus resulting in a faster access time.
        -index-based accessing, makes it simple to read and accessed by just using the indicies of the array.
            Accessing an element takes O(1) time to complete.

    - Disadvantages -
        -Fixed size once it is created. leading to memory wastage in some cases. Not properly modified code will lead to checking every index in the array.
